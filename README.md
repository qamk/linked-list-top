# Linked Lists
This program allows you to make and modify **linked lists** in Ruby. There is a live version on [replt.it].

## Aim
A simple aim, I just had to use OOP to make linked lists. It needs to have the same behaviours as a typical linked list. Nothing much to say. On to tasks!

## Tasks
There was just one main taks, but the optional tasks are interesting. Some of these I may come back to later, as I know how to implement them. Instead my focus was on making an interactive program with the essentials.
- [x] Implement linked list behaviour
  - [x] Implement the to_s recursively
- [x] (Optional) Add an interface
- [x] (Optional) Add commands
- [] (Optional) Add "insert at" and "remove at" functions

## Resources
There was nothing in particular used here. Just information about linked lists. The basic idea is that each "node" has a variable that references/points to anoher node. You can read more generally about linked lists in Ruby on [sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/rubys-missing-data-structure/).
